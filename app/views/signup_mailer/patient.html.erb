    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
    <ul dir="ltr">
      <li>We are a physician-owned platform designed to exponentially grow Direct Primary Care (DPC) and Concierge Medicine awareness among patients.</li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr"><strong>What We Do:</strong></p>
    <ul dir="ltr">
      <li>We are the largest and exclusive directory listing for DPC and Concierge Medicine doctors. We connect patients with best suited boutique direct care doctors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Why Do We Do This?</strong></p>
    <ul dir="ltr">
      <li>We strongly believe in healthcare models that promote direct relationships between patients and doctors. Direct care models fill the emptiness in doctor-patient relationships.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Patients will benefit immensely from having a doctor that truly is on their side, and cares from them.</li>
      <li>Why are direct patient care models a better alternative for patients? - <a href="https://www.findmydirectdoctor.com/blogs/direct-patient-care">Read here.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Quick Summary of Direct Care Benefits:</strong></p>
    <ul dir="ltr">
      <li>You will have a direct relationship with your doctor - Patient centered health care. No insurance companies and no corporate healthcare systems that interfere or influence your doctors decision making.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Your direct care doctor sees less patients, hence has more time for you - Exclusive and privileged.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>No waiting time, no receptionist call holds. You have direct priority access to your doctors cell phone, same day visits, and concierge doctors are usually available for home visits.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>More attention to your health directly translates into better health outcomes for you, along with the peace of mind that your doctor truly is in your corner and cares for you.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>No need to deal with the ineffective and sometimes annoying insurance companies. Although you pay a monthly membership fee to your concierge/DPC doctor, you will make this up by saving many $ from heavy discounts up to &gt;90% (wholesale pricing) on lab work, medications, reduced insurance premiums, etc.</li>
    </ul>
