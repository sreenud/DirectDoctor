          FMDD score (FindMyDirectDoctor score) aims to take a comprehensive overview of a physician’s / provider’s profile using multiple data points with an all inclusive perspective.
          This score is calculated manually by our team based on the information provided by the doctors on their FindMyDirectDoctor profiles, and by accessing publicly available information from state medical boards and other organizations.
          The score is given on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no score and 10 being the highest rated score. (Higher the score, better the doctor, based on our scoring system)
